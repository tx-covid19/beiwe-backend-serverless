# Beiwe
The Onnela Lab at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has developed the Beiwe (bee-we) research platform to collect smartphone-based high-throughput digital phenotyping data. The fully configurable open-source platform supports collection of a range of social, behavioral, and cognitive data, including spatial trajectories (via GPS), physical activity patterns (via accelerometer and gyroscope), social networks and communication dynamics (via call and text logs), and voice samples (via microphone). The platform consists of a front-end smartphone application for iOS (by Apple) and Android (by Google) devices and a back-end system, which supports a web-based study management portal for data processing and storage, based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing infrastructure. Data analysis is increasingly identified as the main bottleneck; our data analysis platform, [Forest](https://github.com/onnela-lab/forest), makes sense of the data collected by Beiwe.

Beiwe can collect active data (participant input required) and passive data (participant input not required). Currently supported active data types for both Android and iOS include text surveys and audio recordings and their associated metadata. The questions, answers, and skip logic can be configured from the web-based dashboard. Passive data can be further divided into two groups: phone sensor data (e.g., GPS) and phone logs (e.g., communication logs). Beiwe collects raw sensor data and phone logs, which is crucial in scientific research settings. Beiwe has two front-end applications, one for Android (written in Java and Kotlin) and another for iOS (written in Swift & Objective-C). The Beiwe back-end, which is based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing infrastructure, has been implemented primarily in Python 3.6, but also makes use of Django (for ORM) and Flask (for API and web server). It also uses several AWS services: primary S3 (for flat file storage), EC2 (servers), Elastic Beanstalk (scaling servers), and RDS (PostgreSQL).

Every aspect of data collection is fully customizable, including which sensors to sample, sampling frequency, addition of Gaussian noise to GPS location, use of Wi-Fi or cellular data for uploads, data upload frequency, and specification of surveys and their response options. Study participants simply download the Beiwe application from the app store and enter three pieces of information: a system-generated 8-character user ID, a system-generated temporary password, and an IP address of the back-end server. If no active data is being collected in the study (i.e., no surveys), this is the only time the participant will interact with the application. However, most studies make use of occasional self-reports or EMA, and some use the audio diary feature to collect rich data on lived experiences.

All Beiwe data is encrypted while stored on the phone awaiting upload and while in transit, and are re-encrypted for storage on the study server. During study registration, Beiwe provides the smartphone app with the public half of a 2048-bit RSA encryption key. With this key, the device can encrypt data, but only the server, which has the private key, can decrypt it. Thus, the Beiwe application cannot read its own temporarily stored data, and the study participant (or somebody else) cannot export the data. The RSA key is used to encrypt a symmetric Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) key for bulk encryption. These keys are generated as needed by the app and must be decrypted by the study server before data recovery. Data received by the cloud server is re-encrypted with the study master key and then stored.

Some of the data collected by Beiwe contain identifiers, such as phone numbers. The Beiwe app generates a unique cryptographic code, called a salt, during the Beiwe registration process, and then uses the salt to encrypt phone numbers and other similar identifiers. The salt never gets uploaded to the server and is known only to the phone for this purpose. Using the industry-standard SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm) and PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithms, an identifier is transformed into an 88-character anonymized string that can then be used in data analysis.

A recent study found that 65% of medical studies were inconsistent when retested, and only 6% were completely reproducible. Reproducibility of studies using mobile devices may be even lower given the variability of devices, heterogeneity in their use, and lack of standardized methods for data analysis. All Beiwe study data collection settings, from sensors to surveys, are captured in a human readable JSON file. These files can be imported into Beiwe and exported out of Beiwe. To replicate a study, the investigator can simply upload an existing configuration file.

# Setup instructions

## Configuring SSL
Because Beiwe often deals with sensitive data covered under HIPAA, it's important to add an SSL certificate so that web traffic is encrypted with HTTPS.

The setup script [uses AWS Certificate Manager to generate an SSL certificate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request.html).  AWS Certificate Manager [will check that you control the domain by sending verification emails](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate.html) to the email addresses in the domain's WHOIS listing.

## Configuring Firebase
To initialize the Firebase SDK, [generate a private key file](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).
Rename the file firebase_cloud_messaging_credentials.json and place it in the project root.

# Configuration settings

All the settings listed here can be found either in the constants file or in the
config/settings.py file, or can have an environment variable set for them.

Optional Settings
if an environment variable is provided for any of these they will override the default
value.  More information is available in the constants and config/settings.py files in the
config directory.

```
    DEFAULT_S3_RETRIES - the number of retries on attempts to connect to AWS S3
        default: 1
    CONCURRENT_NETWORK_OPS - the number of concurrent network operations throughout the codebase
        default: 10
    FILE_PROCESS_PAGE_SIZE - the number of files pulled in for processing at a time
        default: 250
    ASYMMETRIC_KEY_LENGTH - length of key files used in the app
        default: 2048
    ITERATIONS - PBKDF2 iteration count for passwords
        default: 1000
```

Mandatory Settings
If any of these are not provided, Beiwe will not run, empty and None values are
considered invalid  Additional documentation can be found in config/setting.pys.

```
    FLASK_SECRET_KEY - a unique, cryptographically secure string
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - AWS access key for S3
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - AWS secret key for S3

# Development setup
How to set up beiwe-backend running on a development machine (NOT a production instance!  For a production instance,
see https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe-backend/wiki/Deployment-Instructions---Scalable-Deployment)

1. `sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get install postgresql python-psycopg2 libpq-dev`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a file for your environment variables that contains at least these:
    ```
    export DOMAIN_NAME="localhost://8080"
    export FLASK_SECRET_KEY="asdf"
    export S3_BUCKET="a"
    export SYSADMIN_EMAILS="sysadmin@localhst"
    ```
    I usually store it at `private/environment.sh`.  Load up these environment variables by running `source private/environment.sh` at the Bash prompt.

### Local Celery setup
1. Install RabbitMQ (https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/brokers/rabbitmq.html#broker-rabbitmq)
    1. Edit `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf` and add the line `NODE_PORT=50000`
    2. Restart RabbitMQ like this in the Bash shell: `time sudo service rabbitmq-server restart` (`time` isn't necessary, but it tells you how long the command took to execute)
2. `pip install -r requirements_data_processing.txt` (this will install Celery using Pip)
3. Create a file called `manager_ip` in the top level of this `beiwe-backend` repo, and enter two lines in it:
    ```
    127.0.0.1:50000
    [PASSWORD]
    ```
    Where the password is the one you set when setting up RabbitMQ
4. `sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / beiwe ".*" ".*" ".*"`
5. Set the filename of your Firebase credentials JSON file in `libs/push_notifications.py` line 16 (this is a temporary solution)
6. Run celery: `celery -A services.celery_push_notifications worker -Q push_notifications --loglevel=info -Ofair --hostname=%%h_notifications --concurrency=20 --pool=threads`
7. Run `python services/cron.py five_minutes`
