            app.py:67 -- 0 -- 0.405514

         The second statement shows that it took just over the 0.403 time of the sleep statement
         to process between the two p calls.

             [app.py:69] p(1)
             [app.py:70] p()
         This example's output:
             app.py:65 -- 0 -- profiling start...
             app.py:67 -- 1 -- profiling start...
             app.py:69 -- 1 -- 0.32679
             app.py:70 -- 0 -- 0.731086
         Note that the labels are different for the middle two print statements.
         In this way you can interleave timers with any label you want and time arbitrary,
         overlapping subsections of code.  In this case I have two timers, one timed the
         whole process and one timed only the second timer.
