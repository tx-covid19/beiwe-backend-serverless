    Behavior
    This function will download the data from the server, decompress it, and WRITE IT TO FILES IN YOUR CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY.
    If the data in the current working directory includes a "registry.dat" file, the server will use the contents of it to only download files that are new, potentially greatly speeding up your requests.

    Study ID
    study_id is required for any query. The ID of a given study is displayed immediately under the name of the study on the study's page on your website. study_id is a string; it will look like this: 55f9d1a597013e3f50ffb4c7

    Credentials
    If you are using the my_data_access_credentials.py file your credentials will automatically be pulled from it; you will not need to provide those as kwargs. Simply fill in the appropriate access and secret key values to the variables in that file.
    You can find your credentials on your website, click the Manage Credentials tab on the top of the page.

    User Ids
    You may provide a list of user IDs as strings to this function, they should be identical to the user IDs displayed when viewing a study on your website.
    Default behavior: if you provide no users data will be returned for ALL users in that study.

    Data Streams
    To specify a certain data stream add it to a list and provide that list to the data streams folder.  The data streams can be imported from this module, they are ACCELEROMETER, BLUETOOTH, CALL_LOG, GPS, IDENTIFIERS, LOG_FILE, POWER_STATE, SURVEY_ANSWERS, SURVEY_TIMINGS, TEXTS_LOG, VOICE_RECORDING, and WIFI.
    Default behavior: if you provide to data streams data will be returned for ALL available data streams.

    Dates and Times
    Time-string format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss
    (that is an upper case letter T separating the date and the time)
    Example: 1990-01-31T07:30:04 gets you Jan 31 1990 at 7:30:04 AM
    Behavior: the times provided are inclusive, that is you will receive data contained in files with an exactly matching time.
    Default behavior: if you provide no start time parameter data will be returned starting from the beginning of time for that user; if you provide no end time parameter data will be returned up to the most current indexed data.
    NOTE: granularity of requesting time is by hour, data will be updated on the server roughly once an hour.
    NOTE: Use the string from this module's API_TIME_FORMAT variable if you are using the Python DateTime library to generate date strings, or investigate the commented out lines of code in this function.
